My training forum with Laravel 5.5

## TODO

### Near Future

- [x] Add Replies functionality
- [x] Create Thread functionality
- [x] Channels functionality
- [x] Generic Filters functionality
- [x] "My Threads" filter
- [ ] More filters like "favorite" and "popular"
- [x] Migrate to Laravel 5.6
- [x] Add Paginations
- [ ] Meta Informations in threads/replies (examples: "number of replies", etc... it's an improvement of the interface and his data)
- [ ] Delete threads functionality
- [ ] Vote for replies
- [ ] Probably not use channels in a clickable dropdown but like a web interface/button like most of forum



### Far Future
- [ ] Use front-end framework, VueJS is considered
- [ ] Use Laravel Echo for real-time
- [ ] Administration Panel
- [ ] In a long future, i realy would like to rewrite this application in Rust with Rocket (or Actix) for up my skills in Rust and compare performance
- [ ] Rewrite front-end style and remove Bootstrap and experiment with new CSS tools (not be limited by r√©tropcompatibilty), probably it will be done when i will use a front-end framework.
